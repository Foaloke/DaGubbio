The Hydraulicus Water Organ Described by Vitruvius circa AD 20 Longitudinal Cross Section Compressed air shown in green is forced by the pump A into the air vessel B The piston grey is shown at the top of its stroke The air vessel is nearly empty of water blue and the surrounding water chest C is nearly full On the downstroke of the piston, water within the water chest flows into the air vessel from beneath, and continues to maintain air pressure within the vessel Water can flow into and out of the air vessel because there are spaces between the blocks upon which it sits On the upstroke of the piston, water is forced back up into the water chest, compressing the air at the top of the water chest yellow, as well as in the air vessel These reservoirs of compressed air may exist for some little time, subject to leaks and to any key being played When the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the pumping cycle is repeated Valves on the cylinder prevent the escape of air The pressure within the air vessel forces air into the wind chest D, where other valves shown in red may be opened or closed by depressing the organ keys not shown The organ pipes grey are shown truncated The valves slide in and out, perpendicular to the plane of this crosssection There is a hole in each valve which permits air within the wind chest to escape into the corresponding pipe when the valve is open The valve for pipe E is shown in the open position, releasing air into the pipe and causing it to produce a note, according to the musicians art Another bank or banks of pipes, each with its own manual ie, keyboard may be added to give the instrument additional voices or range The configuration shown above is octochord ie, having eight pipes A full modern octave comprised of twelve halfsteps would require four more pipes in the bank The sketch above is not to scale, and the breadth of the organ about 1 cm or six feet is based upon the size of presentday pipe organs
